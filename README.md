# HELLO ðŸ¤—
Glad to meet you, I am called **Ottavio**, a friendly weirdo with big **dreams** of conquering himself and the world, never ceasing to improve through the fine balance of strategic thinking and effort applied on the right tasks!

My skills and knowledges reach areas of backend programming, frontend programming, graphic design, fiction writing, game development, game design, human behaviour, psychology and the emergent possibilities from creatively merging concepts found in these.
